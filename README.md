# 2IC80-Final-Project
Meeting 1:
Discusses LAB relation to project and decided that it can be applied if we get "plug and play" to work.
Then discussed what we thing an automated tool would look like and decided to ask during next lab.
Decided to try and finish ARP and DNS by the end of week 4. Try and work on the sniffing tool meanwhile.
Ask for direction during lab as proceeding fruther seems unclear
